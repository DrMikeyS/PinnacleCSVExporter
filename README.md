# Pinnacle CSV Exporter & Dashboard
There are three parts to the system:

1. Convert Pinnacle Data to CSV
2. Merge Accubook Sessions in Single CSV
3. Compare Pinnacle List to Accubook

The system also provides a very basic dashboard with some key data points you may need.

If you find this useful, checkout the [COVID Vaccine QR Generator](https://github.com/DrMikeyS/COVIDVaccinePatientSlips "COVID Vaccine QR Generator") which may also be useful for your clinic. Also free!
